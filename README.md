# devsummit-berlin-2015-SOI
SOI samples used during the devsummit  *Extending ArcGIS for Server* session in Berlin on November 12, 2015.

They are **Server Object Interceptor** and are written in **C#** using the [ArcObjects .Net SDK](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcobjects-net/conceptualhelp/index.html#/ArcObjects_Help_for_NET_developers/0001000002zs000000/)

#### What are theses samples ?
The samples that you will find there are *"Proof of concept"* : they are *basic*, *not optimized*, and will not take every cases and possibilities into account.

They should be used as simple samples to get started on :
* **How** you can develop an SOI.
* **What** you can do with them.
* and then of course, build great stuff !

#### Use cases
- FilterAccessSOI : Filter **layer visibility** of your services based on the ArcGIS platform **user credentials**
- heamapSOI : Generate a **server-side heatmap** map, based on your point data.


##### TODO :
More explanation on how everything works, should be done in some days.
